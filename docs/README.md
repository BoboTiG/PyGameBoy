# Technical Documentations

I read and take inspiration from several sources:

- [Game Boy Programming Manual v1.1](specs/gameboy-programming-v1.1.pdf): the official document, local copy from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/GameBoyProgManVer1.1) (fixed, optimized & ready to print).
- [Pan Docs](specs/pandocs.txt): everything you always wanted to know about GameBoy, local copy from [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm).
- [PyBoy](specs/PyBoy.pdf): report from students of the university of Copenhagene: Emulation of Nintendo Game Boy (DMG-01), local copy from [Baekalfen/PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy)
