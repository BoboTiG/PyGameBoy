# Technical documentations

I read and take inspiration from several sources:

- [Game Boy Programming Manual v1.0](specs/GameBoyProgrammingManual.pdf): the official document, local copy from [ROMhacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/documents/544/). 
- [Pan Docs](specs/pandocs.txt): Everything you always wanted to know about GameBoy, local copy from [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm). 
- [PyBoy](specs/PyBoy.pdf): report from students of the university of Copenhagene: Emulation of Nintendo Game Boy (DMG-01), local copy from [Baekalfen/PyBoy](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy).
